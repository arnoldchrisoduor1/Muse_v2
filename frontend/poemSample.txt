Whispers of Dawn

The sky exhales a tender sigh,
as night folds into amber light.
Dreams dissolve where swallows fly,
and silence bows to morning’s might.

Soft dew clings to blades of grace,
echoes hum through waking air.
In every beam, a fleeting trace—
of hope reborn, beyond despair.


Unsent Letters

Between folded pages, your name still hums,
a quiet ache pressed into paper.
Ink remembers what courage forgot —
how to speak without trembling.
Time has dulled the sharp edges of us,
but not the echo of almost.
Some silences bloom like flowers
that never meant to open,
but did anyway.
